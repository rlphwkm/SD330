                <h2>About This App</h2>
                <p>
                    Welcome to the Marist College Parking App! This application is designed to provide a convenient way to browse and view parking lot availability and details on campus. With a user-friendly interface, the app aims to enhance your parking experience.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Please note that all the information displayed in this app, including parking availability, operational hours, and security levels, is for demonstration purposes only. The data is not accurate and may not reflect real-world conditions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have used 1 CSS file to keep a uniform look on the app. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The main page will show a list of parking lots, when clicked on, will display more details about the respective lot. The main page will show the most improtant details (according to multiple user feedback) which include the total amount of spaces, the amount of empty spots, and the security level. The main page also has an embed for Google Maps that points at Marist College.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The lots page has a search feature to look up lots easily. The parking lots are clearly displayed on the page and when clicked on, will display further detail about the respective lot.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The map page is an accurate map of Marist College and its parking lots. The map will be on the left while the list of lots is on the right. Due to technical limitations, the map is only an image.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There is a 404 page for the parking app, which will clearly state that the page looked for does not exist. There is also a button in the middle of the page to redirect users back to the home page.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The about page is the one you are currently reading :p
